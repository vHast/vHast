### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ I'm currently working on EestiTalk, a platform to learn Estonian online, it will feature several study techniques and tools that will greatly improve the learning process to anyone interested in the Estonian language, lÃ¤hme!

âš¡ My stack consists on HTML5/CSS , Javascript ES6, SASS, Bash and Bootstrap, I know how to handle them but still honing my skills with them everyday! 

ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning React and Node.js to get in touch with the back-end.

ğŸ¤” Very interested in collaborating with any open-source project / free software (Free as in Freedom) and learning the Free Software ethics!

ğŸ“« You may reach me via my personal website www.fedalvdev.com or email vhast@gmail.com

Happy coding!
