### Hi there 👋

🔭 I'm currently working on EestiTalk, a platform to learn Estonian online, it will feature several study techniques and tools that will greatly improve the learning process to anyone interested in the Estonian language, lähme!

⚡ My stack consists on HTML5/CSS , Javascript ES6, SASS, Bash and Bootstrap, I know how to handle them but still honing my skills with them everyday! 

🌱 I'm currently learning React to complete my Frontend stack and MySQL & PHP to get in touch with the back-end.

🤔 Very interested in collaborating with any open-source project / free software (Free as in Freedom) and learning the Free Software ethics!

📫 You may reach me via my personal website www.fedalvdev.com or email fedvhast@gmail.com

Happy coding!
